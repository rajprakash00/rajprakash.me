description: A brief about me and my work 
---

I’m currently working as a Senior Frontend Engineer in an edtech based organisation(using NextJS 💚, firebase, tailwind and cypress :)

Have been into the world of UI and aesthetic designs for past couple years and still getting intrigued by new frameworks,UIs,and everything TS(always confouded 😵‍💫)

Tech stacks that I enjoy working with: 
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org)

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

- [Styled components](https://styled-components.com/)

- [Framer motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

Currently I'm learning [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html) , [Golang](https://gobyexample.com/) and various new toolings like [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) along with dabbling in some of devOps stuffs. 

Initially started with this by getting into world of open source and got a bunch of learnings from that so still trying to pursue that.
Some of my past contributions are available [here](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+author%3Arajprakash00+archived%3Afalse+is%3Apublic) in Zulip and other orgs.

Apart from all work things I'm into music,football( CR7 is 𓃵 , won't listen to any comparisons..haha) and everything about [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/news/)( still an average awper😢) and FIFA(beat ledgendary AI once or twice😎).

Every social presence of me :
