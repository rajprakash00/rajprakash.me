description: Hello! A brief intro of my portfolio 
---

Iâ€™m a innovative front end developer.
With a keen eye for design,I strive to strike balance between so called aesthetics and functionality.(Atleast that's what I believe ðŸ˜…)

In the past I've worked with few fast paced startups like [Innovaccer](https://innovaccer.com), where I was mainly involved in IAM team.

Iâ€™m currently working as a Senior Frontend Engineer in an edtech based organisation(using NextJS ðŸ’š, firebase, tailwind and cypress :)

After promising myself to have atleast a basic portfolio(being a frontend guy you just feel the urge ðŸ˜©) finally stopped with the procrastination and took some inspirations from various portfolios and Josh's blogs to finally complete a presentable version of my portfolio ðŸ¥³
